""" User configuration file for IPython

This is a more flexible and safe way to configure ipython than *rc files
(ipythonrc, ipythonrc-pysh etc.)

This file is always imported on ipython startup. You can import the
ipython extensions you need here (see IPython/Extensions directory).

Feel free to edit this file to customize your ipython experience.

Note that as such this file does nothing, for backwards compatibility.
Consult e.g. file 'ipy_profile_sh.py' for an example of the things
you can do here.

See http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/IpythonExtensionApi for detailed
description on what you could do here.
