# Markdown for Vim
A complete environment to create Markdown files with a syntax highlight that doesn't suck!

## Features
* Strong support for the Markdown flavor implemented by GitHub: what you see in Vim is what you get on GitHub
* Complete syntax implementation: supports proper nesting of all elements in list items. This is the only plugin that is able to do that (and I believe it since it took me a *while* to make it right)
  * A simple example rendered with this plugin. Headers and the fenced code block in list items are correctly highlighted

  * The same example rendered with the most popular Markdown plugins for Vim

* Code blocks and pieces of Markdown in the current file can be edited in a separate buffer and synchronized back when you finish
  * Inside a Ruby fenced code block, `<Leader>e` opens a temporary buffer with the right file type
  * Select a range in visual mode and `<Leader>e` opens a temporary buffer with file type `markdown`. I call it *Focus Mode* because you can edit a portion of a Markdown file in isolation
  * Finally, on an empty line, `<Leader>e` asks for a file type and then opens a temporary buffer with that file type
  * When you leave the temporary buffer the content syncs back to the main file

* Folding for: headers, code blocks and html blocks
* Format tables automatically (requires [`Tabular`](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular) plugin)
* Automatically detects Jekyll files and adds support for the Liquid template engine
* This is a work in progress. More goodies and improvements are coming (see [TODO](#TODO)). Stay tuned.


## Why?
I wanted strong support for the Markdown flavor implemented by GitHub. I wanted syntax highlighting that would mirror the result I would find later on GitHub. I wanted syntax highlighting that would not break easily. I wanted syntax highlighting that I could rely on (aka rapid feedback). I wanted something more than mere syntax highlighting. The [Markdown Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), unfortunately, is so loosely defined that there are *flavors* of Markdown that are subtly incompatible with each other. The [Markdown supported by GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) is one of them.

    $ vim +PluginUpdate

If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), add the following to your plugin section:

    Plug 'gabrielelana/vim-markdown'

And then execute the following command in your shell:

    $ vim +PlugInstall

If you use [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim), add the following line to your `~/.vimrc`:

    NeoBundle 'gabrielelana/vim-markdown'

And then execute the following command in your shell:

    $ vim +NeoBundleInstall +qall

You can update to the latest version with the following command in your shell:

    $ vim +NeoBundleInstall! +qall

If you use [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), execute the following in your shell:

    $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
    $ git clone https://github.com/gabrielelana/vim-markdown.git

If you are not using a package manager, download the [tarball](https://github.com/gabrielelana/vim-markdown/archive/master.tar.gz) and do this:

    $ cp vim-markdown-master.tar.gz ~/.vim
    $ cd ~/.vim
    $ tar --strip-components=1 --overwrite -zxf vim-markdown-master.tar.gz
    $ rm vim-markdown-master.tar.gz

## Documentation
This section will contain preliminary documentation until full documentation is written.

### Configuration
* `let g:markdown_include_jekyll_support = 0` to disable support for Jekyll files (enabled by default with: `1`)
* `let g:markdown_enable_folding = 1` to enable the fold expression `markdown#FoldLevelOfLine` to fold markdown files. This is disabled by default because it's a huge performance hit even when folding is disabled with the `nofoldenable` option (disabled by default with: `0`)
* `let g:markdown_enable_mappings = 0` to disable default mappings (enabled by default with: `1`)
  * `let g:markdown_enable_insert_mode_mappings = 0` to disable insert mode mappings (enabled by default with: `1`)
  * `let g:markdown_enable_insert_mode_leader_mappings = 1` to enable insert mode leader mappings (disabled by default with: `0`)
* `let g:markdown_enable_spell_checking = 0` to disable spell checking (enabled by default with: `1`)
* `let g:markdown_enable_input_abbreviations = 0` to disable abbreviations for punctuation and emoticons (enabled by default with: `1`)
* `let g:markdown_enable_conceal = 1` to enable conceal for italic, bold, inline-code and link text (disabled by default with: `0`)

### Default Mappings (normal and visual mode)
_mappings are local to markdown buffers_
* `<Space>` (`NORMAL_MODE`) switch status of things:
  * Cases
    * A list item `* item` becomes a check list item `* [ ] item`
    * A check list item `* [ ] item` becomes a checked list item `* [x] item`
    * A checked list item `* [x] item` becomes a list item `* item`
  * Can be changed with `g:markdown_mapping_switch_status = '<Leader>s`
* `<Leader>ft` (`NORMAL_MODE`) format the current table
* `<Leader>e` (`NORMAL_MODE`, `VISUAL_MODE`) `:MarkdownEditCodeBlock` edit the current code block in another buffer with a guessed file type. The guess is based on the start of the range for `VISUAL_MODE`. If it's not possible to guess (you are not in a recognizable code block like a fenced code block) then the default is `markdown`. If it's not possible to guess and the current range is a single line and the line is empty then a new code block is created. It's asked to the user the file type of the new code block. The default file type is `markdown`.

### Optional Mappings (insert mode)
_mappings are local to markdown buffers_
* `<Leader>ft` (`INSERT_MODE`) same as `NORMAL_MODE` `<Leader>ft` with an additional mapping for `INSERT_MODE`
* `<Leader>e` (`INSERT_MODE`) same as `NORMAL_MODE` and `VISUAL_MODE` `<leader>e` with an additional mapping for `INSERT_MODE`

### Motions
* `]]` start of the next header
* `[[` start of the previous header

### While Editing in Insert Mode
* `|` in a table triggers the format command
* `<Tab>`/`<S-Tab>` on a list indents/unindents the item
* `<Tab>`/`<S-Tab>` on a blockquote increases/decreases the quote level
* `<Enter>` on a list item with no text in it (freshly created) deletes everything up to column 0


## Development
### Resources
* [Markdown GitHub Syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)
* [Markdown GitHub API](http://developer.github.com/v3/markdown)

### Syntax Specs
Testing syntax highlighting can be tricky. Here I use the golden master pattern to at least avoid regressions. This is how it works: in `./rspec/features` you will find a bunch of `*.md` files, one for each syntactic element supported. For each of those files there's an HTML file. This file is created with the `:TOhtml` command and it's the reference (aka golden master) of the syntax highlight of the original file. Running `rspec` compares the current syntax highlighting of all the feature's files with the reference syntax highlighting. If you see something wrong when looking at some of the feature's files, you can fix it and then regenerate the golden master files with `GENERATE_GOLDEN_MASTER=1 rspec`


## Known Bugs
* `formatlistpat` doesn't work for ordered lists
* `formatoptions` thinks that `*` in horizontal rules are list items

  * `>` and `<` should properly indent/unindent list items
  * `i_<C-D>` and `i_<C-T>` should properly indent/unindent list items and quote lines

  * List items
  * Check list items
  * Paragraph
    * Start of the next paragraph `}`
    * Start of the previous paragraph `{`
  * Other inline elements
* Folding
  * Fold HTML blocks

  * Always use `synstack` to check the syntax group of a position
